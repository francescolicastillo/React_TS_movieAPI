# Movie finder app with React

This project is an App to practice patterns: fetch data from an API with typed models, show lists and detail pages, and handle error states. Uses react-router-dom for nested routes, dynamic params, and a 404 page. Includes search, pagination, and client-side caching with custom hooks. Strict TypeScript types across components and API responses.
